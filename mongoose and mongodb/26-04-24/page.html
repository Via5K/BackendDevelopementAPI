Query Chain,<br/>
<br/>
This is the process of refinig the executing query before performing that on database first and then performing the actual query.<br/>
We have used .find() to find the matching objects in the database using vaouriteFoods. We needed all teh objects which has burrito as the fav.Food. so we get all teh documents.<br/>
Now, we want to make sure all of them are sorted based on the name; here 1 means ascending and -1 will mean descending. After sorting the docuemnts based on name, we limit the documents searched to only 2 docuements. After limiting we are saying select(). which means that which columns are we requesting? Here we said age:0 which means we want to hide age, where'as if we would have wanted to include it, we would have written something lie age:1.<br/>
At the end we are doing .exec() which is executing the query on the databse. Meaning first we built all the filters and then executed that query.<br/>
