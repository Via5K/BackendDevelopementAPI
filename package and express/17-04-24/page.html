<br/>
Package.json it contains all the npm modules we are using.<br/>
we can create that using npm init.<br/>
Basic information like name and version is stored and required in pacakge.json file.<br/>
<br/>
When we give the version as 1.1.0<br/>
Here those 3 means- &nbsp;Major.minor.patches<br/>
Where Major means it is totally new like it can break or bring functionality which was not there.<br/>
Minor means backwards compatible, and fix of previous version.<br/>
Patches means that it is kind of a bug fix.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using ~ in front of version means that you are allowing npm to install the updated patches, but making sure that npm install it from Minor version only.<br/>
i.e 1.1.* star meaning the latest patch.<br/>
<br/>
When using ^ in fron to fversion that means you are allowing npm to install the updated minors as well. But making sure that Mjor reamains same.<br/>
i.e 1.*.* star meaning the latest version available of minor and patches.<br/>
<br/>
